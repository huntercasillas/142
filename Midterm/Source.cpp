I could not find a way to properly translate each sentence into pig latin, so I focused on translating what I could actually do. 
My code prompts the user for phrases until he or she types "opstay".
It then stores each word into a designated vector and prints out the user phrase after the sentinel "#" is entered. 
It checks to see if the first letter of each word in each phrase is a vowel.
If it is in fact a vowel, it stores these words in a seperate designated vector. 
It then adds "yay" to the end of each word beggining with a vowel and prints them out underneath the user's entire printed phrase.
This translates all words starting with and/or consisting entirely of vowels into proper Pig Latin.

For testing purposes, I avoided all punctuation since my code is designed to work differently then the actual midterm requirements.

Test Cases:

Test 1: A mixture of words starting with both vowels and consonants.

Input - What an amazing and incredible program this is
Expected - 
Print words: What an amazing and incredible program this is
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: anyay amazingyay andyay incredibleyay isyay
Output - 
Print words: What an amazing and incredible program this is
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: anyay amazingyay andyay incredibleyay isyay


Test 2: A phrase with no words begining with a vowel.

Input - This might be the craziest sentence possibly created
Expected -
Print words: This might be the craziest sentence possibly created
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: 
Output -
Print words: This might be the craziest sentence possibly created
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel:

Test 3: A phrase with all words begining with a vowel.

Input - Amazing otters are intelligent and amusing
Expected -
Print words: Amazing otters are intelligent and amusing
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: Amazingyay ottersyay areyay intelligentyay andyay amusingyay
Output -
Print words: Amazing otters are intelligent and amusing
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: Amazingyay ottersyay areyay intelligentyay andyay amusingyay

Test 4: Words that contain only vowels and not a single consonant

Input - ooooo aaa iiii uu
Expected -
Print words: ooooo aaa iiii uu
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: oooooyay aaayay iiiiyay uuyay
Output -
Print words: ooooo aaa iiii uu
Here is the Translation for words begining with a vowel: oooooyay aaayay iiiiyay uuyay

Test 5: Entering the word "opstay"

Input - opstay
Expected - 
...All done!
Output -
...All done!
